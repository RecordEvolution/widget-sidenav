# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run start` — Vite dev server on `localhost:8000` opening `/demo/`, with parallel `vite build --watch` so the demo loads `dist/widget-sidenav.js`.
- `npm run build` — Production library build via Vite/Rollup to `dist/`.
- `npm run watch` — `vite build --watch` only (no dev server).
- `npm run types` — Regenerate `src/definition-schema.d.ts` from `src/definition-schema.json` using `json2ts` (run after editing the schema).
- `npm run analyze` — Generate Custom Elements Manifest via `cem analyze --litelement`.
- `npm run release` — `build` + `types` + `npm version patch` (tag prefix empty) + push commit and tag. The git tag triggers `.github/workflows/build-publish.yml` which publishes to npm and creates a GitHub Release.
- `npm run link` / `npm run unlink` — Link/unlink against a sibling `../RESWARM/frontend` checkout for local integration testing.

There is no test runner or linter configured. Node `>=24.9.0` and npm `>=10.0.2` are required (see `engines`).

## Architecture

Single-file Lit 3 web component (`src/widget-sidenav.ts`) packaged as an ES module library for the IronFlock dashboard platform.

### Versioned custom element tag

The element is registered as `widget-sidenav-versionplaceholder`. At build time, `@rollup/plugin-replace` (configured in `vite.config.ts`) substitutes `versionplaceholder` with the version from `package.json` everywhere it appears, producing tags like `widget-sidenav-1.0.14`. Consumers must use the version-suffixed tag (see `demo/index.html`, which reads `package.json` at runtime to build the tag dynamically). This versioning scheme lets multiple widget versions coexist on the same page in IronFlock dashboards.

### Build pipeline

`vite.config.ts` produces an ES library (`dist/widget-sidenav.js`) with `lit`, `@lit/*`, and `@material/web` marked as Rollup `external`. They must be supplied at runtime by the host (typically via an import map). `@material/web` is a peer dependency, not bundled.

### Schema-driven configuration

`src/definition-schema.json` is the source of truth for the widget's `inputData` shape. It is a JSON Schema with extra IronFlock-specific keys (`order`, `dataDrivenDisabled`, rich `description` fields aimed at AI agents/dashboard editors) consumed by the IronFlock dashboard editor to render configuration UI. `src/definition-schema.d.ts` is generated from it via `npm run types` — never edit the `.d.ts` by hand. `src/default-data.json` provides demo data matching the schema.

### Component contract

The component exposes three reactive properties and one event:
- `inputData: InputData` — title, route, variables, style, and `navItems[]` per the schema.
- `theme: { theme_name, theme_object }` — falls back behind CSS custom properties `--re-text-color` and `--re-tile-background-color`, which take precedence (resolved in `registerTheme`).
- `route: string` — the host's current route. `matchesRoute` highlights an item when the route starts with an absolute item route (`/...`) or ends with / equals a relative one.
- `nav-submit` CustomEvent (bubbles, composed) with `{ path }` — emitted on title/item click for the SPA host to handle navigation.

`resolveRoute` performs two transforms before matching/dispatch: `{{label}}` substitution from `inputData.variables` (URL-encoded), and wildcard segment substitution where `*` in an item route is replaced by the corresponding segment of the current `route`.

### Demo harness

`demo/index.html` is the development entrypoint: it fetches `package.json` to build the versioned tag, loads `dist/widget-sidenav.js`, fetches `src/default-data.json` as `inputData`, and applies a theme from `demo/themes/{light,chalk,vintage}.json`. Material Symbols and fonts are pulled from Google Fonts CDN.
